    This is a hearty breakfast brownie, quick to fix, and yummy. My kids loved
    it! It's also gluten-free and dairy-free.
  </p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>4 ½ cups quick-cooking oats</li>
    <li>¾ cup brown sugar</li>
    <li>¾ cup flax seed meal</li>
    <li>½ cup gluten-free all purpose baking flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 banana, mashed</li>
    <li>¼ cup rice milk</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x10-inch
      baking <br />
      pan.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      Mix oats, brown sugar, flax seed meal, flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and
      salt <br />
      together in a bowl. Mix banana, rice milk, egg, and vanilla extract
      together in a <br />
      separate bowl. Pour banana mixture into flour mixture; stir to combine.
      Pour batter <br />
      into the prepared baking pan.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      Bake brownies in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the
      center comes<br />
      out clean, about 20 minutes. Cover pan with a towel to hold in moisture
      and cool <br />
      brownies for at least 5 minutes before serving.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      Meanwhile, make the rice: Wash rice well and drain in a colander for at
      least 30<br />
      minutes.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion; cook and stir until golden. Add
      cardamom pods,<br />
      cloves, cinnamon stick, ground ginger, and saffron; stir in rice until
      coated with<br />
      spices.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      Heat stock and salt in a medium pot until hot; pour over rice and stir
      well. Add<br />
      chicken mixture and potatoes; stir gently to combine. Bring to a boil.
      Reduce heat to<br />
      very low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and steam for 20 minutes without
      lifting the lid<br />
      or stirring. Spoon biryani onto a warm serving dish.
    </li>
